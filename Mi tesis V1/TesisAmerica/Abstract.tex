The recognition of hand gestures has been prominent in different areas of computer science, eg. HCI is important because it helps create a natural interaction between the computer and the user, so have developed various methods to find the model that works in real time and in different circumstances. So it is to create a model that merges the information provided by the Kinect device, then the recognition of static and dynamic gestures in real time under conditions of low light and when there is occlusion. This model be applied to create a system that serves as a control computer, is that gestures can be used as the cursor.
