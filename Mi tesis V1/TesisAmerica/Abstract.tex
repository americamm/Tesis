The recognition of hand gestures has been prominent in different areas of computer science, eg. HCI (Human Computer Interaction), is important because it helps create a natural interaction between the computer and the user, so varios methods have been developed to find the model that works in real time and in different circumstances. In this work we proposed a model that uses the information from the two Kinect devices in order to recognize static and dynamic gestures in real time under poor ligth and partial occlusion.
