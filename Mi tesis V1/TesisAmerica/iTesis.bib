abstract = {With the advent of various video game consoles and tablet devices gesture recognition got quite popular to control computer systems. E.g. touch screens allow for an intuitive control of small 2d user interfaces with finger gestures. For interactive manipulation of 3d objects in a large 3d projection environment a similar intuitive 3d interaction method is required. In this paper, we present a dynamic 3d hand and arm gesture recognition system using commodity hardware. The input data is captured with low cost depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) and HD color sensors (e.g. Logitech C910). Our method combines dynamic hand and arm gesture recognition based on the depth sensor with static hand gesture recognition based on the HD color sensor.},

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCI often prefer SPC than other methods offered to them, because of quality-of-life issues. The incidence of significant complications might not be as high as previously reported, and with a commitment to careful follow-up, SPC can be a safe option for carefully selected patients if adequate surveillance can be ensured.},

abstract = {The support-vector network is a new leaming machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high- dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demon- strated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a real-time hand detection system which can reach high speed and accuracy. The system is based on Gentle Adaboost and cascade classifier. To improve the performance of the system, three efficient features are selected to describe the visual properties of human hands. In addition, the detection is accelerated due to several optimization methods, including the method for fast calculation of \{HOG\} features, improved cascade classifier and skin-color pre-detection. Experiments were performed on our self-constructed dataset, the results showed that the detection rate of the system can reach 0.889 while the false rate is 0.010 at the speed of 32.6339\&\#xa0;ms per frame on a Intel Core i5-2400 \{CPU\} running at 3.1\&\#xa0;GHz. },

@article{Silva2001,
abstract = {In computer vision, occlusions are almost always seen as undesirable singularities that pose difficult challenges to image motion analysis problems, such as optic flow computation, motion segmentation, disparity estimation, or egomotion estimation. However, it is well known that occlusions are extremely powerful cues for depth or motion perception, and could be used to improve those methods. In this paper, we propose to recover camera motion information based uniquely on occlusions, by observing two specially useful properties: occlusions are independent of the camera rotation, and reveal direct information about the camera translation. We assume a monocular observer, undergoing general rotational and translational motion in a static environment. We present a formal model for occlusion points and develop a method suitable for occlusion detection. Through the classification and analysis of the detected occlusion points, we show how to retrieve information about the camera translation (FOE). Experiments with real images are presented and discussed in the paper. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@book{Smith1999,
abstract = {Markets have always influenced the central thrust of the semiconductor industry. Beginning in the early eighties, the personal computer (PC) market has been the dominant market influencing the semiconductor industry. Single-chip microprocessors (MPUs) enabled what became the huge PC market, which ultimately overshadowed the earlier minicomputer and mainframe computer markets. The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business. Since DSP is the mathematical manipulation of those digitized information signals, specialized math circuitry is required for efficient signal processing-circuitry that was previously confined to classical DSP chips},

@article{Viola2001,
abstract = { This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

abstract = {Hand gestures have great potential to act as a computer interface in the entertainment environment. However, there are two major problems when implementing the hand gesture-based interface for multiple users, the complexity problem and the personalization problem. In order to solve these problems and implement multi-user data glove interface successfully, we propose an adaptive mixture-of-experts model for data-glove based hand gesture recognition models which can solve both the problems. The proposed model consists of the mixture-of-experts used to recognize the gestures of an individual user, and a teacher network trained with the gesture data from multiple users. The mixture-of-experts model is trained with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and an on-line learning rule. The model parameters are adjusted based on the feedback received from the real-time recognition of the teacher network. The model is applied to a musical performance game with the data glove (5DT Inc.) as a practical example. Comparison experiments using several representative classifiers showed both outstanding performance and adaptability of the proposed method. Usability assessment completed by the users while playing the musical performance game revealed the usefulness of the data glove interface system with the proposed method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
