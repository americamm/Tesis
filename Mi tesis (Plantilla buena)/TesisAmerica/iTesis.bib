As the 1977 and 1987 editions by Gonzalez and Wintz, and the 1992 edition by Gonzalez and Woods, the present edition was prepared with students and instructors in mind. The material is timely, highly readable, and illustrated with numerous examples of practical significance. All mainstream areas of image processing are covered, including a totally revised introduction and discussion of image fundamentals, image enhancement in the spatial and frequency domains, restoration, color image processing, wavelets, image compression, morphology, segmentation, and image description. Coverage concludes with a discussion on the fundamentals of object recognition. Read more at http://ebookee.org/Digital-Image-Processing-2Ed-Gonzalez-woods\_59369.html\#x6zHhXYRriyOVDcM.99},

@article{Silva2001,
abstract = {In computer vision, occlusions are almost always seen as undesirable singularities that pose difficult challenges to image motion analysis problems, such as optic flow computation, motion segmentation, disparity estimation, or egomotion estimation. However, it is well known that occlusions are extremely powerful cues for depth or motion perception, and could be used to improve those methods. In this paper, we propose to recover camera motion information based uniquely on occlusions, by observing two specially useful properties: occlusions are independent of the camera rotation, and reveal direct information about the camera translation. We assume a monocular observer, undergoing general rotational and translational motion in a static environment. We present a formal model for occlusion points and develop a method suitable for occlusion detection. Through the classification and analysis of the detected occlusion points, we show how to retrieve information about the camera translation (FOE). Experiments with real images are presented and discussed in the paper. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Viola2001,
abstract = { This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

abstract = {Hand gestures have great potential to act as a computer interface in the entertainment environment. However, there are two major problems when implementing the hand gesture-based interface for multiple users, the complexity problem and the personalization problem. In order to solve these problems and implement multi-user data glove interface successfully, we propose an adaptive mixture-of-experts model for data-glove based hand gesture recognition models which can solve both the problems. The proposed model consists of the mixture-of-experts used to recognize the gestures of an individual user, and a teacher network trained with the gesture data from multiple users. The mixture-of-experts model is trained with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and an on-line learning rule. The model parameters are adjusted based on the feedback received from the real-time recognition of the teacher network. The model is applied to a musical performance game with the data glove (5DT Inc.) as a practical example. Comparison experiments using several representative classifiers showed both outstanding performance and adaptability of the proposed method. Usability assessment completed by the users while playing the musical performance game revealed the usefulness of the data glove interface system with the proposed method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
